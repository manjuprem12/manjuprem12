## Hi there 👋 I'm Manju Prem,


## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Frontend & Full-Stack Developer who enjoys building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications, with a strong focus on React and Vue. I care deeply about user experience, component-driven architecture, and writing maintainable, scalable code across the stack.

I enjoy turning complex requirements into intuitive interfaces and building reliable backend services that support them, creating end-to-end solutions that feel smooth and thoughtful.

Alongside full-stack development, I have a solid foundation in Data Science & AI, with hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and data engineering. I like using data to uncover insights and add intelligent features to applications.

I enjoy working at the intersection of full-stack development and data, building products that are both user-friendly and insight-driven 🚀
